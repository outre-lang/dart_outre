# Baize

üñãÔ∏è A scripting language made for unknown reasons.

# Language Specification

The language syntax is a mix of Go and JavaScript. It is also highly dynamic with only basic features. Baize script files have an `.baize` extension. The [`baize_compiler`](./packages/baize_compiler) and [`baize_vm`](./packages/baize_vm) provides the compiler and the runtime for the language.

But is it fast? The performance is reasonable for a mere scripting language. It can do `100000` iterations and function calls in less than 1.5 seconds. I would say, it's pretty freaking good for a mere scripting language.
