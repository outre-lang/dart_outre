# Fubuki

üñãÔ∏è A hand-crafted scripting language exclusively made for Tenka modules.

# Language Specification

The language syntax is a mix of Go and JavaScript. It is also highly dynamic with only basic features. Fubuki script files takes an extension of `.fbs`. The [`fubuki_compiler`](./packages/fubuki_compiler) and [`fubuki_vm`](./packages/fubuki_vm) provides the compiler and the runtime for the language.

But is it fast? The performance is reasonable for a mere scripting language. It can do `100000` iterations and function calls in less than 1.5 seconds. I would say, it's pretty freaking good.
